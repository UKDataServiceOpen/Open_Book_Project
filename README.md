What skills are needed to create effective, clear, and functional Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto documents?

This document presents version 1 of a skills framework for creating Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto documents. Its aim is to support educators, trainers, and learners in developing the skills required for working with these tools. The framework focuses on essential competencies for using Jupyter and Quarto effectively, rather than broader data analysis skills.

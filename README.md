**Welcome to the Open Book Project!**

The **Open Book Project** is an initiative that combines open teaching datasets from the UK Data Service with Quarto and Jupyter Notebooks.

**Project aims**

-   To create adaptable teaching resources for educators.

-   To enhance reproducibility skills among students. 

## Open books

The project will develop **Open books** – versatile teaching resources that integrate data, code and narrative text to introduce data analysis skills. These resources are desgined to be used as they are or adapted to suit teaching needs.

Each Open Book is available in multiple formats:

-   html - for a static, read-only viewing.

-   Quarto (.qmd) and Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) - for local use and editing.

-   Binder for interactive online analysis without local set-up

The open books are currently in development. You can already explore an example:

## Skills framework

What skills are needed to create effective, clear, and functional Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto documents? The Open Book project presents [version 1 of a skills framework](https://ukdataserviceopen.github.io/Open_Book_Project/Skillsframework) for creating Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto documents.

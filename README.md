**Welcome to the Open Book Project!**

The Open Book Project is an initiative that combines open teaching datasets from the UK Data Service with Quarto and Jupyter Notebooks.

The project aims:

-   to create adaptable teaching resources for educators.

-   to enhance reproducibility skills among students.Â 

## Open books

The first aim is to develop Open books, which are versatile teaching resources that can be used and adapted as needed. Each open book combines data, code and text introduction data analysis skills. They will be available in a variety of formats:

-   html - for a static version.

-   Quarto (qmd) and Jupyter notebook (.ipynd) for using and adapting locally.

-   Via Binder for online interactive analysis.

The open books are in development. But you can explore an example book 'Reduce care use?'.

## Skills framework

What skills are needed to create effective, clear, and functional Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto documents? The Open Book project presents [version 1 of a skills framework] (https://ukdataserviceopen.github.io/Open_Book_Project/Skillsframework) for creating Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto documents.

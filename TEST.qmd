**Should car users pay more tax? Should we reduce car use for the sake of the environment?**

This book uses R coding to explore public attitudes to car use and environmental crisis. Follow the steps to create

-   descriptive statistics.

-   data visualisations (bar charts).

## Set-up

Run the code below before starting the exercise, this code opens packages we need to analyse the data. The ### are notes that explain the purpose of the code. Annotating code helps humans understand what is going on.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#install packages...

library(haven)  ### To open Stata or SPSS datasets
library(dplyr)  ### For data manipulation 
library(survey) ### For survey data analysis 
library(srvyr)  ### For manipulation of survey data

```

## Data

The dataset is [British Social Attitudes Survey, 2017, Environment and Politics: Open Access Teaching Dataset](University%20of%20Manchester,%20Cathie%20Marsh%20Institute%20for%20Social%20Research%20(CMIST),%20UK%20Data%20Service.%20(2022).%20British%20Social%20Attitudes%20Survey,%202017,%20Environment%20and%20Politics:%20Open%20Access%20Teaching%20Dataset.%20%5Bdata%20collection%5D.%20NatCen%20Social%20Research,%20%5Boriginal%20data%20producer(s)%5D.%20NatCen%20Social%20Research.%20SN:%208849,%20DOI:%20http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8849-1) (Study number 8849). Use the code to read in the data.

```{r read data}

BSAenviro <- read_dta("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JenniferLB/Open_data/master/bsa2017_open_enviropol.dta") %>%
  mutate(across(
    c(cartaxhi, carnod2, carreduc, carallow, carenvdc),
    as_factor
  ))

```

## Let's explore

Let's start by looking at the data. The code below produces a summary of the data.

```{r inspect data}

dim(BSAenviro) ### how many cases and variables?
names (BSAenviro) ### an ordered list of variables names
```

Questions

1.  How many variables and cases?

2.  What is the name of the 11th variable?

The 11th variable is called `carreduc`. What does this mean? Let's use code to find out more.

```{r}
attr(BSAenviro$carreduc,"label") # Variable labels are stored as attibutes, which we can look at. 
```

## Attitudes towards car use and the environment

We are now going to explore attitudes towards car use and the environment. Above we encountered the variable `carreduc`. We are also going to examine `Cartaxhi`. How would we change the code below to inspect the variable label? Have a go and see.

```{r}
attr(BSAenviro$carreduc,"label")

```

How were these questions asked in the survey? You can check the survey [Questionnairre](https://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/8450/mrdoc/pdf/8450_bsa_2017_full_questionnaire_documentation.pdf) to find out (see page 170). Or see the picture below.

Now let's look at the responses to the questions.

```{r}
table(BSAenviro$cartaxhi)
table (BSAenviro$carreduc)
```

From the tables above we get a glimpse of the data. But, we can do some improvements.

-   One issue to address is that survey data can include non-substantive options like *“skipped”*, *“not answered”*, or *“cannot choose”*. In this case, we will assign them as missing values (`NA`).

-   We can also organise the categories to reflect their ordering i.e. agree, strongly, agree etc.

The code below will do this data cleaning work for our two variables as well as other variables from the same set of questions. It is important to runt he code, before we make the tables.

```{r}
clean_agreement_var <- function(x) {
  var_label <- attr(x, "label")  # store the label before modifying
  
  x <- as.character(x)
  x <- case_when(
    x %in% c("skipped", "not answered", "cannot choose") ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ x
  )
  
  x <- factor(x, levels = c(
    "agree strongly",
    "agree",
    "neither agree nor disagree",
    "disagree",
    "disagree strongly"
  ), ordered = TRUE)
  
  attr(x, "label") <- var_label  # re-attach the label
  x
}

```

```{r}

BSAenviro %>%
  filter(!is.na(cartaxhi)) %>%
  count(cartaxhi, name = "n") %>%
  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Attitudes toward higher car taxation (cartaxhi)")


```

```{r}
BSAenviro %>%
  filter(!is.na(carallow)) %>%
  count(carallow, name = "n") %>%
  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
